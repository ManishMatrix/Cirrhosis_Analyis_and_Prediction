# Cirrhosis_Analyis_and_Prediction

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical insights into the **Cirrhosis of the Liver** dataset. The analysis aims to understand survival outcomes based on medical features using visualization and statistical techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Visualizations (histograms, survival distribution, categorical comparisons)
- Insights into the impact of clinical variables on patient survival

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Cirrhosis Patient Survival** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other medical sources. It contains features like:
- Age, gender
- Bilirubin, cholesterol, albumin, prothrombin time
- Edema, ascites, hepatomegaly
- Drug treatment and survival status

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManishMatrix/cirrhosis-analysis.git
   cd cirrhosis-analysis

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook cirrhosis_analysis.ipynb


📈 Visuals and Insights
The notebook includes:

Distribution of survival status

Feature correlation heatmaps

Survival vs. clinical variables

Statistical significance testing for categorical and continuous variables

📚 Future Work
Integrate machine learning models for survival prediction (e.g., logistic regression, survival models)

Time-to-event analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimator or Cox regression
